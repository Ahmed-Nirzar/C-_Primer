#      Chapter 1          



`exp1.cpp  -`  Using the IO library, we can extend our main program to prompt the user to give us two numbers and then print their sum.    
        
`exp2.cpp  -`  `Exercise 1.3` - Write a program to print Hello, World on the standard output.    
`exp3.cpp  -`  `Exercise 1.4` - Our program used the addition operator, +, to add two numbers. Write a program that uses the multiplication operator, *, to print the product instead.   
     
`exp4.cpp  -`  `Exercise 1.5` - We wrote the output in one large statement. Rewrite the program to use a separate statement to print each operand.    
           
`exp5.cpp  -`  Use a while to write a program to sum the numbers from 1 through 10 inclusive.     
`exp6.cpp  -`  `Exercise 1.9` Write a program that uses a while to sum the numbers from 50 to 100.     
`exp7.cpp  -`  `Exercise 1.10` In addition to the ++ operator that adds 1 to its operand, there is a decrement operator (--) that subtracts 1. Use the decrement operator to write a while that prints the numbers from ten down to zero.      

`exp8.cpp  -`  `Exercise 1.11` Write a program that prompts the user for two integers. Print each number in the range specified by those two integers.       

`exp9.cpp  -`  We can rewrite this program using a for loop to sum the numbers from 1 through 10       
`exp10.cpp -`  `Exercise 1.12` What does the following for loop do? What is the final value of sum?      
int sum = 0;       
for (int i = -100; i <= 100; ++i)       
sum += i;       

`exp11.cpp -`  `Exercise 1.13 (Part 1)` Rewrite the first two exercises from § 1.4.1 (p. 13) using for loops.      
`exp12.cpp -`  `Exercise 1.13 (Part 2)` Rewrite the first two exercises from § 1.4.1 (p. 13) using for loops.       
`exp13.cpp -`  We’ll keep reading numbers until there are no more numbers to read.       
`exp14.cpp -`  `Exercise 1.18` Compile and run the program from this section giving it only equal values as input. Run it again giving it values in which no number is repeated.       

`exp15.cpp -`  `Exercise 1.19` Revise the program you wrote for the exercises in § 1.4.1 (p. 13) that printed a range of numbers so that it handles input in which the first number is smaller than the second.       

`exp16.cpp -`  `Exercise 1.21` Write a program that reads two Sales_item objects that have the same ISBN and produces their sum.      
`exp17.cpp -`  `Exercise 1.22` Write a program that reads several transactions for the same ISBN. Write the sum of all the transactions that were read.      

`exp18.cpp -`  `Exercise 1.24` Test the previous program by giving multiple transactions representing multiple ISBNs. The records for each ISBN should be grouped together.      
        
`exp19.cpp -`  `Exercise 1.23` Write a program that reads several transactions and counts how many transactions occur for each ISBN.       
`exp20.cpp -`  `Exercise 1.25` Using the Sales_item.h header from the Web site, compile and execute the bookstore program presented in this section.
