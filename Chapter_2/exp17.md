To calculate a mortgage payment, choosing the appropriate data types for the rate, principal, and payment is crucial to ensure accurate calculations and efficient use of memory. Here are the types you would typically use and the reasons for selecting each:

1. Interest Rate (`rate`) :

`Type`: double
`Reason`: The interest rate for a mortgage is typically expressed as a decimal (0.045 for 4.5%). Using a `double` provides the necessary precision for these fractional values. The `double` type is chosen over `float` because mortgage calculations often involve many computations that require higher precision to avoid rounding errors that can accumulate over time.

2. Principal (`principal`) :

`Type`: double
`Reason`: The principal amount of a mortgage can be very large, often in the hundreds of thousands or even millions of dollars. While an `int` or `long` could technically hold these values, using a `double` allows for more precise arithmetic operations, especially when calculating the interest that will be compounded over time. Additionally, using `double` ensures compatibility with the interest rate calculations.

3. Payment (`payment`) :

`Type`: double
`Reason`: Mortgage payments are typically fractional amounts, including cents (e.g., $1500.75). Using a `double` ensures that these fractional payments are represented accurately. The `double` type is preferred over `float` for the same reasons as above: higher precision and reduced risk of rounding errors over repeated calculations.
