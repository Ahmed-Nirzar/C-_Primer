(a) `std::cin >> int input_value;`    
This definition is illegal because you cannot declare a variable inside an input statement. The variable needs to be declared separately before it can be used.     

(b) `int i = { 3.14 };`    
This definition uses list initialization (also known as uniform initialization) which is prevents narrowing conversions. The value 3.14 is a `double`, and initializing an `int` with a `double` using list initialization will cause a narrowing conversion, which is illegal in C++11 and beyond. So it can be illegal.    

(c) `double salary = wage = 9999.99;`     
This definition is legal if wage is declared previously.     

(d) `int i = 3.14;`     
This definition is legal, but it will cause a warning because a `double` value (3.14) is being implicitly converted to an `int`. The fractional part will be truncated, resulting in i being assigned the value 3.
