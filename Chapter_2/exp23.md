(a) `int ival = 1.01;`  (`valid`)     
This definition is legal, but it will generate a warning because a `double` value (`1.01`) is being implicitly converted to an `int`. The fractional part (`0.01`) will be truncated, and ival will be assigned the value 1.    

(b) `int &rval1 = 1.01;` (`invalid`)     
This definition is invalid because rval1 is declared as a reference to an `int`, but it is being initialized with a `double` value (`1.01`). References must be initialized with an object of the same type. Additionally, you cannot bind a non-const lvalue reference to a temporary or a literal.     

(c) `int &rval2 = ival;` (`valid`)      
This definition is legal because rval2 is declared as a reference to an `int`, and it is being initialized with an existing `int` variable ival. This is a correct and typical use of references.    

(d) `int &rval3;` (`invalid`)      
This definition is invalid because references in C++ must be initialized when they are declared. Unlike pointers, references cannot be left uninitialized.
