(a) `r2 = 3.14159;`: `Valid`. Assigns 3.14159 to d through r2.     

(b) `r2 = r1;`: `Valid`. Assigns the value of i (which is 0) to d through r2.      

(c) `i = r2;`: `Valid` (with a potential warning). Assigns the value of d (as double, truncated to int) to i.     

(d) `r1 = d;`: Valid (with a potential warning). Assigns the value of d (as double, truncated to int) to i through r1.
