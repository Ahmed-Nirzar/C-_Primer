`a = 42;` is `legal`, and `a` becomes `42`.    
`b = 42;` is `legal`, and `b` becomes `42`.    
`c = 42;` is `legal`, and `c` becomes `42`.    
`d = 42;` is `legal`, and `d` (which is a reference to a) makes `a` become `42`.     
`e = 42;` is `illegal` because `e` is a constant integer.    
`g = 42;` is `illegal` because `g` is a constant integer.
